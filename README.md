# SystemMOTD
This my first ever plugin I've coded, Anyways I hope you enjoy it! The point of it is so that you can change your bukkit/spigot server's MOTD (that's displayed when you first join.. and what you see in your server list).

# Commands
These are the commands.
 /help - Presents a help message with all the commands | it also included the version, creator(s) (me)
 
 /setmotd - Sets the JoinMessage MOTD (you would be better off doing that in the config)
 
 /setsystemmotd - Sets the MOTD for your server list (Does not require a restart, It will however if it is done in the config)
 
 # Permissions
These are the permissions.
   motd.set - This permissions works on both the /setmotd & /setsystemmotd command
   
   motd.check - Allows you to check the MOTD
   
   Obviously if you are OPPed you will not need any of these permission nodes
   
 # Creator(s) & Notes
 This is my first plugin, please feel free to take this up and edit it to make it better for your needs, However I hope you enjoy it!
